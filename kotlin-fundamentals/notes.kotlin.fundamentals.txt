Object-oriented features
Functional language features
Higher order functions
Filtering and mapping data
Nullability
Working with infinite streams
Improved support for generics

Installing Kotlin: I just use gradle
Or sdkman
"sdkman current"
running "kotlinc" gives a repl
leave repl with ":quit"
":help" for help
Files have a .kt extension
In Kotlin: argument name, then type
fun main(args: Array< String > ) {
    print( "Hello world" )
}
Don't need a class. No need to specify a return. 
Return void is done w/Unit

compile with 
kotlinc Hello.kt
Give you HelloKt.class
kotlinc hello.kt -include-runtime -d hello.jar
This tells the compiler to include the runtime
Then you can run the jar w/java -jar hello.jar
Easy to distrubute

What is Kotlin?
JVM language
Object Oriented
Functional
less ceremony than Java

Creating a function outside of a class did not work for me
In Person class:
var Name: String = ""
name of var, then the type
it must be initialized
